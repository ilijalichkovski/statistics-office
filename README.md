# Mentor project: Text-to-SQL interface for the Macedonian National Statistics Office

I will be adding useful resources here.

* [This paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.01066v1) gives an overview, presents some good datasets and **metrics to evaluate text-to-SQL performance**, and introduces methods to get better performance out of LLM-based text-to-SQL systems (like the ones you'll be working on)
* [WikiSQL](https://github.com/salesforce/WikiSQL) is a dataset you could potentially use for fine-tuning (of course, once you translate the natural language query to Macedonian
* [GEPA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19457) is an outstanding technique for prompt optimization that sample-efficiently increases performance, even compared to other leading methods for prompt optimization like MIPROv2 and fine-tuning approaches using GRPO.
* [DSPy docs](https://deepwiki.com/stanfordnlp/dspy) that are more readable than the [official documentation](https://dspy.ai/api/). You can also find examples of [DSPy in production](https://dspy.ai/community/use-cases/) here.
